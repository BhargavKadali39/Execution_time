# Execution_time
calculating the execution time of a program

Here simple time module is used to calculate the total execution time of given sourcecode.

Logic behind is nothing much, the module saves the time when the program gets started and right before it ends saves the time again but in different variable and then endtime gets subtract by start time to get the Execution_time.

Reliability is more as we are using inbuilt module to calculate the time

NOTE: the duration may increase with respect to the time taken by user to give certain inputs if needed.

Inside the given source code add your needed code in the area where included with the help of comments

output for the given program

    output:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    Execution time is : 0.13704204559326172
